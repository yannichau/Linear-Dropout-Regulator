# 5mA, Linear Performance, Fast Response LDO Regulator

This is the repository containing all the files of my Y4 Full Custom Integrated Circuit and Design coursework files.

The LDOC1S2YTC is a 5mA Low Dropout (LDO) linear regulator 
that provides good line and load regulation. Its linear performance 
and fast response, combined with its highly compact form factor, 
makes it a suitable candidate for low-noise and speed-critical 
applications such as wireless and wired communications.
